Reestar-Project

Resstar is a responsive and visually appealing recipe webpage designed using HTML and CSS. The project focuses on displaying a variety of food recipes in an elegant card-style format with an intuitive interface. The layout is optimized using CSS display properties, ensuring a user-friendly experience across devices.

Key Features:

1. Recipe Cards: Each dish is presented in a card layout, making it easy for users to explore the recipes. The cards include:

* Ghee Roast Dosa: A crispy dosa variation from South Indian cuisine, roasted in ghee.
* Tangy Sticky Rice: A Chinese-inspired comfort food, perfumed with sweet and savory flavors.
* Ghee Masal Dosa: A traditional South Indian breakfast served with tomato and coconut chutney.
* Ramen Noodles: A spicy, homemade ramen noodles recipe far superior to store-bought versions.
  
2. Contact Form:
   
The webpage also includes a basic contact form where users can enter:

* Name
* Age
* Email
The form allows users to easily reach out for inquiries or additional information.

3. Search Bar:
A functional search bar is integrated at the top, allowing users to search through the recipes and find their preferred dishes quickly.

Technologies Used:

* HTML5:
Structural elements are used to define different sections of the webpage (header, main content, footer).
The webpage is semantically organized for better readability and accessibility.
* CSS3:
Flexbox is used extensively to manage the layout of recipe cards, ensuring they are responsive across screen sizes.
Styling elements: CSS is used for custom fonts, hover effects on buttons, card shadowing for visual hierarchy, and form styling.
A consistent color scheme with contrast between text and background is employed for enhanced readability.

Responsive Design:

The webpage is designed to be responsive across various devices, adjusting seamlessly from desktop to mobile views.
Media queries ensure the layout remains intuitive and organized on smaller screens.
